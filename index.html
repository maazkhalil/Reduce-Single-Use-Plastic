    <h2 id="main"> RECYCLE YOUR PLASTIC</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <h2>    As we all know that our use of plastic is destroying the world each day and it is becoming a major reason 
            for air pollution,  environmental pollution and all. The real question is how can we recycle our plastic
            and what's the alternative?</p1>
    <br>
    <h2>Idea:</h2>
    <h2>There are many apps that are controlling plastic waste and waste material and they are playing a big role in
        cleaning and recycling it, but all of these apps dont have one thing and that is "earning from waste".
        Yes you read that write, we can make a machine just like a vending machine but instead of paying to machine, 
        the machine will pay you for your plastic. This will not recycle their plastic but it'll put people on track,
        and if we execute it write, this can work.</h2>
